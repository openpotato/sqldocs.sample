# SQLDocs Sample Documentations

This repository includes the souce code for the following sample database documentations made with [SQLDocs](https://github.com/openpotato/sqldocs) and [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/):

+ [Sample documentation for Firebird](https://openpotato.github.io/sqldocs.sample/firebird)
+ [Sample documentation for PostgreSQL](https://openpotato.github.io/sqldocs.sample/postgres)

To connect both documentations, we use [Mike](https://github.com/jimporter/mike), a Python utility that makes it easy to deploy multiple versions of a MkDocs-powered docs to a Git branch. 

## Can I help?
